# Derived-Class--Administrator.java

The code I created is in Administrator.java

Absolute Java Chp 7 Project 4

Define a class called Administrator, which is a derived class of the class SalariedEmployee in Display 7.5. You are to supply the following additional 
instance variables and methods:

• An instance variable of type String that contains the administrator’s title (such as "Director" or "Vice President").

• An instance variable of type String that contains the administrator’s area of responsibility (such as "Production", "Accounting", or "Personnel").

• An instance variable of type String that contains the name of this administrator’s immediate supervisor.

• Suitable constructors, and suitable accessor and mutator methods.

• A method for reading in an administrator’s data from the keyboard.

Override the definitions for the methods equals and toString so they are appropriate to the class Administrator.
Also, write a suitable test program.

Requirement from Professor:

a. You need to implement a 3 argument and a 6 argument constructor. The 6  argument constructor calls the 3 argument constructor of its parent class.

b. The toString() and equals() methods call the corresponding methods of their parent class.

c. Your program may use the Scanner in the main method of the test program to read user data.

Submit the Administrator and test program files.
